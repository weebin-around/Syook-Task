This project involves training object detection models using the YOLOv8 framework. We have two objectives:

Train a model to detect persons in images.
Train a model to detect Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) on cropped images of persons.
The dataset is provided in PascalVOC format, and we will convert the annotations to YOLOv8 format before training the models.
